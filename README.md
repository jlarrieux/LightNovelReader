# Light Novel Reader

This project takes in a url to a light novel and strip out the html tags (and selected words), then
send it to whatever is listening via the Android intent system (the expectation is the [@Void Aloud 
reader](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.hyperionics.avar&hl=en_US&gl=US)
android app).
